# Session Notes – 2025-08-27

## Summary
- Initialized repo and pushed to GitHub (`main`).
- Implemented USAspending connector with real API pagination and mapping to a canonical schema.
- Added schema helpers (`src/schema.py`) and USAspending mapping module.
- Wrote pytest unit tests for mapping and paginated fetch (all passing).
- Added a minimal FastAPI web UI to trigger runs and browse recent events/runs.
- Updated env example and README with USAspending tuning knobs.

## Current Status
- CLI can run `usaspending` and write to SQLite; runs are recorded in `ingest_runs`.
- Web UI available at `uvicorn src.web:app --reload --port 8000` to start runs and inspect results.
- Email alerts are optional; if SMTP env vars are unset, failures show as console warnings.

## Next Session – Proposed Tasks
1. Implement real SEC Form D connector (fetch + parse + map) and add tests.
2. Implement SBIR/STTR ingestion and mapping with tests.
3. Add normalization and dedup/entity resolution (exact by UEI/DUNS/CIK; heuristic by name+country+domain) with indexes.
4. Enhance UI: pagination, sorting, export link, and run detail/error views.
5. Reliability: retries/backoff/rate limits and idempotent reruns with run IDs.
6. Optional: migrate to Postgres (SQLAlchemy + Alembic), add CI (pytest/ruff), and containerize.
