# Session Notes – 2025-08-27

## Summary
- Initialized repo and pushed to GitHub (`main`).
- Implemented USAspending connector with real API pagination and mapping to a canonical schema.
- Added schema helpers (`src/schema.py`) and USAspending mapping module.
- Wrote pytest unit tests for mapping and paginated fetch (all passing).
- Added a minimal FastAPI web UI to trigger runs and browse recent events/runs.
- Updated env example and README with USAspending tuning knobs.

## Current Status
- CLI can run `usaspending` and write to SQLite; runs are recorded in `ingest_runs`.
- Web UI available at `uvicorn src.web:app --reload --port 8000` to start runs and inspect results.
- Email alerts are optional; if SMTP env vars are unset, failures show as console warnings.

## Next Session – Proposed Tasks
1. Implement real SEC Form D connector (fetch + parse + map) and add tests.
2. Implement SBIR/STTR ingestion and mapping with tests.
3. Add normalization and dedup/entity resolution (exact by UEI/DUNS/CIK; heuristic by name+country+domain) with indexes.
4. Enhance UI: pagination, sorting, export link, and run detail/error views.
5. Reliability: retries/backoff/rate limits and idempotent reruns with run IDs.
6. Optional: migrate to Postgres (SQLAlchemy + Alembic), add CI (pytest/ruff), and containerize.

# Session Notes – 2025-08-29

## Summary
- USAspending: implemented real pagination grouped by award types (contracts, grants), added retries/backoff, and persisted raw API pages to `raw_ingest`.
- Mapping: broadened field handling (e.g., `Recipient DUNS Number`, `Base Obligation Date`, `Last Modified Date`).
- CLI: default `--sources` set to `usaspending` only for MVP.
- Observability: added streaming logs in pipeline and connector to show group/page progress (`python -u`).
- Tests: `pytest -q` passes (4 tests) locally.

## Current Status
- Live runs against USAspending succeed for payload validation in isolation, but end-to-end runs intermittently fail due to API constraints and connection drops (latest: `RemoteDisconnected`).
- The connector now splits requests per award group and uses valid sort fields; further tuning needed for grants fields/sort and to trim initial window/pages to stabilize.

## Next Steps (MVP)
1. Add connector logs per page/group (done). Reduce initial window to 90 days and `USASPENDING_MAX_PAGES=1..2` to validate live ingest.
2. Finalize grants field list/sort to avoid 400s in all cases; verify at least one page returns records in each group.
3. Rerun: `python -u -m src.cli run --sources usaspending --window-years 1` (adjust window via env/flag if needed).
4. Verify DB: check `ingest_runs` and sample events in `funding_events`; confirm in UI: `python -u -m uvicorn src.web:app --reload --port 8000`.
5. Document runbook commands and minimal `.env` (SMTP optional; set later).

## Commands
- Ingest: `USASPENDING_MAX_PAGES=1 python -u -m src.cli run --sources usaspending --window-years 1`
- Web UI: `python -u -m uvicorn src.web:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
